Putting the Data Analytics Lifecycle into Practice
•From Module 2 you learned a strategy to approach any data 
analytics problem:
• Phase 1: Discovery 
• Phase 2: Data Preparation 
• Phase 3: Model Planning  (covered in Module 4)
• Phase 4: Model Building
• Phase 5: Communicate Results
• Phase 6: Operationalize
•To begin to analyze the data you need:
 1. A tool that allows you to look at the data – that is “Python or R”.
 2. Skill in basic statistics – we’re providing a refresher.

Do I have enough 
information to draft an 
analytic plan and share for 
peer review?
Do I have 
enough good 
quality data to 
start building 
the model?
Do I have a good idea 
about the type of model 
to try?  Can I refine the 
analytic plan?
Is the model robust 
enough?  Have we 
failed for sure?

Module 3: Review of Basic Data Analytic Methods Using R
R, also called the Language for Statistical Computing:
• Developed Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the 
University of Auckland in the nineties.
• Open Source Implementation of the S Language, so GNU is S.
• S Language was developed by John Chambers in the Bell 
Laboratories in the eighties.
• R provides a wide variety of statistical techniques and 
visualization capabilities.

• Another very important feature about R is that it is highly 
extensible. Because R is open source.
• It actually was the vehicle to bring the power of S language to 
a larger community.
• Like every programming languages, there are pros and cons.

Start with Pros first ,
• It is open source, so it is free.
• R’s graphical capabilities are top notch and it is very easy to build 
publications quality plots.
• In comparison to many other statistical software packages, R uses a
command R uses a command line interface, which means that you have
to actually code things in your console and in scripts.
• While this might be frustrating at first, it makes your work reproducible.
You can now wrap your work in R scripts, which you can then easily
share with your colleagues. Because of these advantages, R appeals to a
large audience both in academia and in business.

Pros (Cont.) ,
• Moreover, it's fairly easy to create R packages, which are
extensions of R, aimed at solving particular problems.
• R's very active community has created thousands of well-
documented R packages for a very broad range of applications
in the financial sector, health care and for cutting edge
research.

However, as with anything, there are also some disadvantages,
• R seems to be relatively easy to learn at first, but it is hard to really 
master it. 
• Also the fact that R is command-based is a frightening detail for 
statisticians that are used to the typical point and click programs out 
there. 
• This steep learning curve sometimes results in poorly written R code that 
can be hard, both to read and to maintain. 
• Furthermore, poorly written R code can become slow if you're working 
with large data sets.

Five Things to Remember About R 
1. (Almost) everything is a object
2. (Almost ) everything is a vector 
 Example: x <- 3       -- x is a vector of length 1
v <- c(2,4,6,8,10) -- v is a vector of length 5
3. All commands are functions 
 Example: quit() or q(), not q
4. Some commands produce different output depending…
5. Know your default arguments!

Getting Data Into R: External Sources
• R supports multiple file formats
 read.table()is the main function 
• File name can be a URL
 read.table(“http://ahost/file.csv”, sep=“,”) is the 
same as read.csv(…)
• Can read directly from a database via ODBC interface
 mydb <- odbcConnect(“MyPostgresDB”, …)
• R packages exist to read data from Hadoop or HDFS (more later)
Module 3: Basic Data Analytic Methods Using R
Note! R always uses the forward-slash (“/”) character in full file names
“C:/users/janedoe/My Documents/Script.R”

log 
Outliers, anomalies
• Possibly evidence of dirty data
Shape of the Distribution
• Unimodal? Bimodal?
• Skewed to left or right?
• Approximately normal? Approximately lognormal?
Example - Distribution of purchase size ($)
• Range from 0 to  > $10K, right skewed
• Typical of monetary data
• Plotting log of data gives better sense of distribution
• Two purchasing distributions

Hypothesis Testing
•Fundamental question: "Is there 
a difference between the 
populations based on samples?“
 Examples : Mean, Variance
•Null  hypothesis : There is no 
difference
•Alternate hypothesis : There is a 
difference

Null and Alternative Hypotheses: Examples
Module 3: Basic Data Analytic Methods Using R 53
Alternative HypothesisNull Hypothesis
The model predicts better than the 
null model:
• The average prediction error 
from the model is smaller than 
that of the null model
The best estimate of the outcome is 
the average observed value:
• The mean is the "Null Model”
The variable does affect outcome:
• Coefficient value is non-zero
This variable does not affect the 
outcome:
• The coefficient value is zero
Interventions based on model 
predictions improve revenue:
• A/B Testing, ANOVA
The model predictions do not improve 
revenue:
• Revenue is the same with or 
without intervention

Hypothesis Testing: Summary
• Calculate the test statistic
 Different hypothesis tests are 
appropriate, in different situations
• Calculate the p-value on the test 
statistic
• If p-value is "small" then reject the null 
hypothesis
 "small" is often p < 0.05 by convention 
(95% confidence)
 Many data scientists prefer a smaller 
threshold.

Confidence Intervals
Module 3: Basic Data Analytic Methods Using R 65
If x is your estimate of some unknown value μ, 
the P% confidence interval
is the interval around x that μ will fall in, with 
probability P.
Example:
• Normal data N( μ, σ) 
• x is the estimate of μ
• based on n samples
μ falls in the interval 
x ± 2σ/√n
with approx. 95% probability
("95% confidence")

Example
The defect rate of a disk drive manufacturing process is within 0.9% -
1.7%, with 98% confidence. We inspect a sample of 1000 drives from 
one of our plants.
Module 3: Basic Data Analytic Methods Using R 66
• We observe 13 defects in 
our sample.
• Should we inspect the plant 
for problems?
• What if we observe 25 
defects in the sample?

Check Your Knowledge
•Refer back to the ANOVA example on an earlier slide. What do 
you think? Does the difference between offer1 and offer2 make 
a practical difference? Should we go ahead and implement one 
of them? 
•If yes, and the costs were US $25 for each offer1 and US $10 for 
offer2, would you still make the same decision?
•In our manufacturing plant example, assuming you would check 
the plant for problems in the manufacturing process, how might 
you justify this decision financially?

Logistic Regression Use Cases•The preferred method for many binary classification problems:Especially if you are interested in the probability of an event, not just predicting the "yes or no“Try this first; if it fails, then try something more complicated•Binary Classification examples:The probability that a borrower will default The probability that a customer will churn•Multi-class exampleThe probability that a politician will vote yes/vote no/not show up to vote on a given bill

Diagnostics (Cont.)•Sanity check the coefficientsDo the signs make sense? Are the coefficients excessively large?Wrong sign is an indication of correlated inputs, but doesn't necessarily affect predictive power.Excessively large coefficient magnitudes may indicate strongly correlated inputs; you may want to consider eliminating some variables, or using regularized regression techniques.Infinite magnitude coefficients could indicate a variable that strongly predicts a subset of the output (and doesn't predict well on the rest).Try a Decision Tree on that variable, to see if you should segment the data before regressing.

Let us assume that a disease exists and a test for it has been developed.We know the following probabilities:P(C) = probability of having the disease = .05                          P(¬C)  = probability of not having the disease = .95P(A|C) = probability of testing positive, if having the disease = .95P(A|¬C)  = probability of testing positive, if not having the disease = .1In order to find if this a reliable test, we need to solve for the probability of having the disease given you have a positive test result, P(C|A).   From Bayes’ Law, P(C|A) =  P(A|C) P(C) / P(A).  We need to compute P(A).P(A) = probability of testing positive  = P(C) * P(A|C) + P(¬C)  * P(A|¬C) = .05 * .95 + .95 * .1 = 0.1425 •So, P(C|A) = P(A|C) P(C) / P(A) = (.95  * .05) / 0.1425 = 1/3, which means that the probability of a patient having the disease given that the patient tested positive is only one third.  This may not be a good test!Asecondexample ofBayes Law:

Decision Tree
111Module 4: Analytics Theory/Methods
Decision Trees are a flexible method very commonly deployed in data miningapplications. In this lesson we will focus on Decision Trees used forclassification problems.There are two types of trees; Classification Trees and Regression (orPrediction) Trees• Classification Trees – are used to segment observations into morehomogenous groups (assign class labels). They usually apply to outcomesthat are binary or categorical in nature.•Regression Trees– are variations of regression and what is returned ineach node is the average value at each node (type of a step function withwhich the average value can be computed). Regression trees can beapplied to outcomes that are continuous (like account spend or personalincome).
Copyright © 2014 EMC Corporation. All Rights Reserved.
Decision Tree Classifier - What is it?•Used for classification:Returns probability scores of class membershipWell-calibrated, like logistic regressionAssigns label based on highest scoring classSome Decision Tree algorithms return simply the most likely classRegression Trees: a variation for regressionReturns average value at every nodePredictions can be discontinuous at the decision boundaries•Inputvariables can be continuous or discrete•Output: A tree that describes the decision flow. Leaf nodesreturn either a probability score, or simply a classification.Trees can be converted to a set of "decision rules“"IF income < $50,000 AND mortgage_amt > $100K THEN default=T with 75% probability“

Decision Tree
113Module 4: Analytics Theory/Methods
Decision Trees are a popular method because they can beapplied to a variety of situations.The rules of classification are very straight forward and theresults can easily be presented visually.Additionally, because the end result isa series of logical “if-then” statements, there is no underlying assumption of alinear (or non-linear) relationship between the predictorvariables and the dependent variable.

We will use the same example we used in the previous lessonwith Naïve Bayesian classifier.For the people with good credit and we start at the top of thetree the probability is 70% (700 out of 1000 people have goodcredit). The process has decided that we are going to split howmuch is in the savings account into two groups.One group with savings less than $100 or between $100 to $500.The second group is the rest of the population which hassavings of $500 to $1000 or greater than $1000 or no knownsavings.

We compute the probability of good credit at the second nodeand we find in the second savings category 245 out of 294 havegood creditand the probability at this node is83%.Looking at the other node (Savings <100 or Savings 100:500)we look into housing. We split this node into Housing (free,rent)as one group and Housing (own) as the other. Computingprobability of good credit at housing (own) node we see that 349out of 501 people have good credit, a70%probability.

121Module 4: Analytics Theory/Methods
Traversing down the housing (free, rent) node we split now onthe variable known as personal. The two groups are Personal(female, male divorced/ separated) and Personal(male,married/widowed,male_single). In the node on the right,the probability of good credit is 0.6; in the node on the left, theprobability of good credit is 41% (which is less than 50%, so wehave shaded this box red).

123Module 4: Analytics Theory/Methods
We can see that for this case, we might want to work with theprobabilities, rather than the class labels; this tree would onlylabel 88 rows (out of 1000) of the training set as "bad", which isfar less than the 30% "bad" rate of the training set, and of thosecases labeled "bad", only 59% of them would truly be bad.Tuning the splitting parameters, or using arandom forestorother ensemble technique (more on that later) might improve theperformance.

Decision Trees are greedy algorithms. They take decisionsbased on what is available at that moment and once a baddecision is taken it is propagated all the way down.An ensemble technique may randomize the splitting (or evenrandomize data) and come up with multiple tree structures. Itthen assigns labels by looking at the average of the nodes in allthe trees and assigns class labels or probability values.

General Algorithm•To construct tree T from training set SIf all examples in S belong to some class  in C, or S is sufficiently "pure", then make a leaf labeled C.Otherwise: select the “most informative” attribute A partition S according to A’s valuesrecursively construct sub-trees T1, T2, ..., for the subsets of S•The details vary according to the specific algorithm – CART, ID3, C4.5 – but the general idea is the same

Step 1: Pick the Most “Informative" Attribute•Entropy-based methods are one common way•H = 0 if p(c) = 0 or 1 for any classSo for binary classification, H=0 is a "pure" node•H is maximum when all classes are equally probableFor binary classification, H=1 when classes are 50/50

Let's compute the conditional entropy of credit class conditioned on housing status. In the top row of the table are the probabilities of each value. In the next two rows are the probabilities of the class labels conditioned on the housing value.Note that each term inside parentheses is the entropy of the class labels within a single housing value.The conditional entropy is still fairly high; but it is a little less than the unconditioned entropy.

Time Series AnalysisBusinesses perform sales forecasting to look ahead in order to plantheir investments, launch new products, decide when to close orwithdraw products, etc.The sales forecasting process is a critical one for most businesses.Part of the sales forecasting process is to examine the past. How welldid we do in the last few months or what were our sales in the sametime period for the last few years?Time Series Analysis provides a scientific methodology for salesforecasting.Time Series Analysisis the analysis of sequential dataacross equally spaced units of time. Time Series is a basic researchmethodology in which data for one or more variables are collectedfor many observations at different time periods.

Time Series AnalysisThe main objectives in Time Series Analysis are:•To understand the underlying structure of the time series by breaking it down to its components.•Fit a mathematical model and then proceed to forecast the futureThe time periods are usually regularly spaced and the observationsmay be either univariate or multivariate.Univariatetime series arethose where only one variable is measured over time, whereasmultivariate time series are those, where multiple variables aremeasured simultaneously. The internal structure of the data mayspecify a trend, seasonality, cycles or random.

YoyoDyne Churn Prediction Case Study 
Situation Synopsis
• Retail Bank, Yoyodyne Bank wants to improve the Net Present Value  (NPV) 
and retention rate of the customers . 
• They want to establish an effective marketing campaign targeting customers 
to reduce the churn rate by at least five percent. 
• The bank wants to determine whether those customers are worth retaining. 
In addition, the bank also wants to analyze reasons for customer attrition and 
what they can do to keep them. 
• The bank wants to build a data warehouse to support marketing and other 
related customer care groups.

Components of 
Analytic Plan Retail Banking: Yoyodyne  Bank
Discovery Business 
Problem Framed How do we identify churn/no churn for a customer?
Initial Hypotheses Transaction volume and type are key predictors of churn rates
Data & Scope 5 months of customer account history
Model Planning  - 
Analytic Technique Logistic regression to identify most influential factors predicting churn
Result &                             
Key Findings 
Once customers stop using their accounts for gas and groceries, they will 
soon erode their accounts and churn.
If customers use their debit card fewer than 5 times per month, they will 
leave the bank within 60 days.
Business Impact
If we can target customers who are high-risk for churn, we can reduce 
customer attrition by 25%.  This would save $3 million in lost customer 
revenue and avoid $1.5 million in new customer acquisition costs each 
year.

Quick Summary of Final Presentation Components 
Module : The Endgame5 24

--- Page 23 ---
Copyright © 2014 EMC Corporation. All Rights Reserved.
Top 10 Tips, Tricks, & Pitfalls to Avoid for the Final Presentation 
1. Be visual.  Generally, the more visual the better. Up to a point.  
2. Be MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive).
3. Tie your ideas together….don’t force people to tie your ideas together, guide people 
and help them draw logical connections.
4. Don’t forget that not everyone has gone through the Discovery phase like you have.  
5. Context is key.  Orient people to the project itself, as well as the graphics you use, 
the terminology and jargon (spell out acronyms).
6. Don’t assume people see the obvious benefits.
7. Measure and quantify the benefits.  Be specific.  “$8.5M in annual cost savings” is 
much stronger than “Great Value”.
8. Be patient.  You may have to tell your story more than once…consider these 
sessions opportunities to refine your message and share good work that was done.
9. Let the intended audience guide you in shaping the right message and level of 
detail.
10. Avoid long bulleted lists 

Overview of Code & Technical Documentation 
26
• Consider the interests of your technical audience:
 How will the project affect them? 
 In what ways will it change their day-to-day roles, or existing processes? 
 Be aware of the implications of your work on their roles as you create 
these technical deliverables.
• 2 Technical deliverables:
 Code 
 Technical specifications and documentation. 
Module : The Endgame5
--- Page 25 ---
Copyright © 2014 EMC Corporation. All Rights Reserved.
Considerations for Technical Specifications & Documentation 
27
• Inputs & Pre-processing:
 Discuss the expected pre-processing steps before data goes to the model code.  
 Document expected input, data format, source tables, and units.
 Describe the processing script are you using.
 Explain how the outputs are created.
• Exception handling :
 Explain how to deal with exceptions to the model.
 Provide guidance for making decisions on the exceptions.  
• Post-processing:
 After you create the output, discuss any post-processing before going to the next 
step.
 Interpreting a threshold as opposed to a simple yes/no.
Module : The Endgame5
Approach the documentation as if it’s for an API (application programming interface)

Providing Your Code 
28
• Test for accuracy in the production environment
• Ensure the code will run quickly and meet SLAs
• Include comment lines in the code
• Hold a briefing with the engineers who will implement the code

• Implementing new price tiering 
approach increases the precision of 
price promotions by 23% 
• Price optimization model explains 
92% of customer behavior 
• Model can be run in production 
environment on daily basis, if 
needed, to tailor changes to direct

Evolution of a Graph, Sponsor Example
Module : The Endgame5 36
• Before the project, pricing promotions 
were offered to all customers equally
• With the new approach:
 Highly loyal customers do not receive as 
many price promotions, since their loyalty 
is not strongly influenced by price
 Customers with low loyalty are influenced 
by price, and we can now target them for 
this purpose better
• We project multiple cost savings with this 
approach 
 $2M in lost customers
 $1.5M in new customer acquisition costs
 $1M in reductions for pricing promotions

A Quick Word About Using 3D Charts:  Avoid Them! 
Module : The Endgame5 42
Chart A:  2-Dimensional Chart B:  3-Dimensional
• Difficult to gauge actual data
• Scaling becomes deceptive
• Does not make graphic fancier, just 
harder to understand 
• Simple
• Easy to understand
• Focus on the data, not the graphics
